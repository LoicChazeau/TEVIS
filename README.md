TEVIS application using React Native and an API
============================

Here is the beginning of our project: a cross platform application developed by TEVIS. It allows to comment everything on the internet. This is the MVP of the application, it uses React native for the user interface and Laravel for the API that communicates with a database. Authentication is done with Firebase and Redux.

----------


Getting started
----------------------------
You'll need some solid base on :

 - CSS
 - Javascript
 - Typescript
 - Fetch(for the API)

---
## Expo
Firstly you'll need Expo to be able to see the application you can do so by following this tutorial:

https://docs.expo.io/get-started/installation/

## Start the project 
Follow these instructions to start the react native project

    $>git clone git@github.com:LoicChazeau/TEVIS.git

    $>cd TEVIS/

>You will be redirected to your localhost expo. Here you can choose to launch the project on an Android emulator, IOS, on the website or directly on your phone.

To install Android studio and launch the application on an emulator watch this:

Resources
----------------------------


I also use the React Developer Tools extension which is useful to fix bugs. Here is a link to the official React Native doc:
